## Directory
* GA2.ipynb is the working of GA's on temperature Data
* GA3.ipynb is the working of GA's on Generated Data
* Model's folder consists of a text file with model and correponding output image
* This can be used to reproduce the graph

## Requirements
* deap library for genetic algorithms : https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/
* numpy for data generation and storage : https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html
* pandas for data manipulation : https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/?v=20210127140625
* scipy for scientific functions : https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/?v=20210127140625
* plotly for plotting : https://plotly.com/python/


These links also available in Help tab in Jupyter notebook if relevant libraries are installed

## Reference Material
* https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12700.pdf : For the overall process for GA2 and GA3 
* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0364.pdf : for error analysis theory

## Warnings
* The GA used is based on loosely typed Symbolic Regression methodology, better results possible from Strongly typed approach
* The optimization function, functions that are used in the main algorithm are basic ones used in relevant documentation, better functions/methods specififc to this problem could exist
