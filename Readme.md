## Directory
* GA2.ipynb is the working of GA's on temperature Data
* GA3.ipynb is the working of GA's on Generated Data
* Model's folder consists of a text file with model and correponding output image
* This can be used to reproduce the graph

## Requirements
* deap library for genetic algorithms
* numpy for data generation and storage
* pandas for data manipulation
* scipy for scientific functions
* plotly for plotting

## Warnings
* The GA used is based on loosely typed Symbolic Regression methodology, better results possible from Strongly typed approach
* The optimization function, functions that are used in the main algorithm are basic ones used in relevant documentation, better functions/methods specififc to this problem could exist
